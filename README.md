The App depends on two websites that provide us free forecast API.

1. [Map Box](https://www.mapbox.com/ "Mapbox") website provide location coordinate for an address
2. [Weather Stack](https://weatherstack.com/ "weatherstack") provide forecast through the coordinate that we got from [Map Box](https://www.mapbox.com/ "Mapbox")
